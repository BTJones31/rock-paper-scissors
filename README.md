This is my attempt at making a simple game of rock paper scissors.  The player is prompted to type in their selection, a randomly generated computer choice is selected and a winner is determined and the results are printed to a webpage.

This is all very basic stuff but things are beginning to make more sense for me.  I'm learning to break down problems into smaller chunks making what seems like a very difficult task into more achieveable chunks.
